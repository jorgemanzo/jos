1.
Having a handler function for each exception/interrupt allows us to handle
each vector differently depending on what occured. For a page fault for
example, we may need to allocate more space to allow the faulting instruction. 

2.
I did not modify softinit.c in any way. When the user attempts int 14,
the permission for page fault is ring 0. The user program is in ring 3,
so because of this, a general protection fault occurs since the user 
doesnt have permission for page fault handling.

3.
If the handler is not available in ring 3, it will  generate a general
protection fault because the user code doesnt have permission.

4. The user-hello program just wants to print something to the screen.
It needs to be able to create an interrupt for the kernel to print
the character.
