My lab work from my Operating Systems Course
---

This repo consists of the final lab work from my Operating Systsmes course. It follows the "OSTEP" *Operating System: Three Easy Pieces* (Virtualization of the hardware, Peristence of important data, and Concurency) book. I really enjoyed this course; however, 10 weeks was not enough for me to feel satisfied with my understanding. Thus I am reading the OSTEP book on my own with hopes to replicate what was accomplished here. It uses QEMU for hardware emulation.

Things you should know:
- Some of this work was provided by the instructor (**blue9057**).
- In order to compile, you will need QEMU.
